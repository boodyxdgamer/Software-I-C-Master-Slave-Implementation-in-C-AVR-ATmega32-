Software I²C Communication Flow (Master ↔ Slave)

🔧 Initialization
- Master:
  - Sets SDA and SCL as output and drives them HIGH
    → Pull-up resistors simulate idle bus state
- Slave:
  - Sets SDA and SCL as input with internal pull-up
    → Ready to detect start condition

🚦 Start Condition
- Master pulls SDA LOW
  → Delay
  → Then pulls SCL LOW
    → Signals start of transmission

📤 Sending a Byte (Master Side)
- For each bit:
  → Set SDA to bit value (1 or 0) using bit masking
  → Delay
  → Set SCL HIGH
  → Longer delay (ensures slave reads bit)
  → Set SCL LOW
- Repeat 8 times for full byte

📥 Receiving a Byte (Slave Side)
- Wait for SDA LOW while SCL HIGH
  → Detects start condition
- Enter read loop:
  → For each bit:
    → Wait for SCL to go HIGH
    → Read SDA state and store bit
    → Wait for SCL to go LOW
- After 8 bits, compare with slave address

✅ Acknowledgment (ACK/NACK)
- If address matches:
  → Slave switches SDA to output, pulls it LOW
  → Delay
  → Switches back to input with pull-up
- Master:
  → Switches SDA to input
  → Reads ACK bit
  → If ACK received → Sends data byte
  → If NACK → Aborts or retries

🔄 Data Byte Transmission
- Same bit-wise transmission as address
- Slave receives and stores byte
  → Returns to main loop for action

🛑 Stop Condition
- Master:
  → Sets SCL HIGH
  → Delay
  → Sets SDA HIGH
    → Signals end of transmission
- Slave:
  → Detects SDA HIGH while SCL HIGH
    → Recognizes STOP
    → Executes preset block of code
    → Waits for next start condition (SDA LOW while SCL HIGH)
